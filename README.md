# ParkEase

## Project Idea

The idea of this project is to create a web application that can be used as a marketplace for parking spaces. It’s for two user groups , Providers and Seekers. 

## User Groups

- **Providers:** These users can list their available parking spaces, including details like address, hourly rate, and images
- **Seekers:** These users can search for available spaces near their desired location , select a specific space , their parking duration and pay the corresponding fee to get their space for that timeframe.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Map:** An interactive map displays available parking spaces marked with a pin when the application is opened. 
- **Detailed Listings:**  Each pin provides details about the specific parking space, including images, address, and hourly rate. 
- **Search and Filter:** Users can search for parking by location or filter based on criteria like price and distance.
- **Seamless Booking and Payment:** Users can seamlessly book a chosen parking space for their desired duration and securely pay the fee through the application.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Stress:** No more circling for parking, especially in unfamiliar locations or during crowded events.
- **Efficient Parking Management:** Parking space providers can monetize their unused spaces, leading to better parking utilisation.
- **Convenience:** The application offers a user-friendly platform to manage parking needs in a centralised location.

## Target Audience

- People with vehicles visiting unfamiliar locations.
- Individuals in a situation where there is insufficient parking at the event.
- People with parking spaces which are not effectively in use  (garages, driveways) looking to generate income.

## Tech Stack

- **MERN Stack:** ParkEase will be built using the MERN stack.
  - *Front-End:* ReactJS for a user-friendly interface.
  - *Back-End:* Node.js and Express.js for server-side operations.
  - *Database:* MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
